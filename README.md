# mashup
Mashup of Google Maps and Google News created for HarvardX class CS50x on edX.

This web app allows you to search for a location (US only) prefilling the text box as you type. Several news icons will appear
at the location you searched, which when clicked, will show a few links to news stories relevant to that location. Many random
locations with respective news will appear when the map is initialized and any time the map is dragged or zoom level changes.
